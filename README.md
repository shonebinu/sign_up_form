# sign_up_form
I worked again in this project and made a [clone](https://github.com/shonebinu/sign_up_form/tree/odin_clone) of the example given in the TOP project brief. 
 An easy 'sign up form' interface to learn about forms and validations.

 ## Features
 - Responsive (Mobile, Tablet and Desktop).
 - Aesthetic Dark Interface (Inspired from Tailwind colors).
 - Validations, mainly the 'confirm password' input checks with 'password' input to see if they are both of same value, if not, set's custom validity and prevents the submit.
